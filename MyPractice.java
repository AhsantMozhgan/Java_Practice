//1- (Finding the factors of an integer) Write a program that reads an integer and displays all its smallest
// factors in increasing order. For example, if the input integer is 120, the output should be as
// follows: 120=2* 2*2* 3*5.

//        2- (Displaying pyramid) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer from 1 to 15 and
//        displays a pyramid, as shown in the following sample run:
//Enter the number of lines: 7

//        3- (Perfect number) A positive integer is called a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of all of its positive divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is the first perfect number, because 6=3+2+1. The next is 28=14+7+4+2+1.
//        There are four perfect numbers less than 10000. Write a program to find all these four numbers.
